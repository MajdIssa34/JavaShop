# __Inventory Management System__

## __Project Overview:__

This Inventory Management System is a comprehensive Java application designed to showcase the practical use of several important design patterns, including Observer, Composite, Singleton, Factory, and Strategy. The system allows for dynamic inventory management, item crafting and uncrafting, and offers a flexible search functionality, making it an ideal project for demonstrating advanced object-oriented design principles.

### __1. Key Features:__
+ Dynamic Inventory Management: Manage a collection of items with functionalities to add, remove, and search items within the inventory.
+ Crafting and Uncrafting Mechanism: Craft items from basic components and uncraft them back to their original components, demonstrating the Composite pattern.
+ Flexible Item Search: Implement multiple search strategies for item retrieval, illustrating the Strategy pattern in action.
+ Design Patterns Integration: Seamlessly integrates Observer, Composite, Singleton, Factory, and Strategy patterns to solve various design challenges.
+ Modular Design: Highly modular code structure that facilitates easy extension and maintenance.
  
### __2. Design Patterns Used:__
+ Observer Pattern: For updating various components of the system when changes occur in the inventory.
+ Composite Pattern: To handle items that can be crafted from and uncrafted into other items.
+ Singleton Pattern: Ensures a single instance of the Storage class throughout the application.
+ Factory Pattern: Used for creating items in a flexible manner, allowing for future expansion.
+ Strategy Pattern: Enables switching between different item search strategies dynamically.
